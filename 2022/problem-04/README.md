# Problem 04: Elf Cleaning Detail

Elfs are cleaning their workspaces, there is overlap in area assignments.
We need to find how many elf pairs have overlapping assignments.

## Sample

```BASH
2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8
```

1. No overlap
2. No overlap
3. One section (7) overlaps
4. Complete overlap
5. Complete overlap
6. Three sections (4, 5, 6) overlaps

In this case 2 pairs fully overlap.

## Part One

Find out how many elf pairs *fully* overlap.
