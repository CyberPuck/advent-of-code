# Problem 01: Star Fruit for the deer

Elfs are listing the amount of calories (kcals) they have:
- Each line is an individual count of kcals for a given food item
- Each elf separates their food stuffs with a new line

## Requirements

- Given a list of kcals, which elf is carrying the most kcals

## Example Input

```BASH
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

Following details:
- 5 total elfs
- Efl 1: 6000 kcals
- Elf 2: 4000 kcals
- Elf 3: 11000 kcals
- Elf 4: 24000 kcals
- Efl 5: 10000 kcals

Elf 4 carrying 24000 kcals is the go to elf, and the answer for this example.

## Part 2: The Elfs realzie they need to track the top 3

In a stroke of absolute luck the elfs decided they need to track the top three
to ensure they don't run out of snacks?  LMAO

Any who given the same sample above, the output expected would be:

Elf 4 with 24000 kcals, Elf 3 with 11000 kcals, and Elf 5 with 10000.
