# Part 3: Reorganizing The Bags

Elfs are organizing the bags, looks like some items were added to the wrong
compartment in each bag.  Every bag has two compartments.

## Bag Rules

- Each compartment holds the same amount of stuff
- All items added to a compartment must be of the same type
- Item type is IDes as an upper or lower case character (`A` vs `a`)

## Item Priority

Items are prioritized by:
1. Items ascii `a` through `z` are 1 - 26
2. Items ascii `A` through `Z` are 27 - 52

## Sample

```BASH
