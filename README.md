# Advent of Code Solutions

This repo holds the solutions I have developed for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Directories point to years -> problem number for finding a problem to look at.

Code maybe in different languages depending on the year/problem.
I'm mainly using this as an excuse to try new languages, techniques, or just
getting some coding in.
